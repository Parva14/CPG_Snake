/**
 * \brief Creates a HebiTrajectory object for a single joint using the given

 * \param num_waypoints The number of waypoints.
 * \param positions A vector of waypoints for this joint; should be
 * num_waypoints in length. Any elements that are NAN will be considered free
 * parameters, and will be set by the function.  Values of +/-infinity are not
 * allowed.
 * \param velocities An optional vector of velocity constraints at the
 * corresponding waypoints; should either be NULL or num_waypoints in length.
 * Any elements that are NAN will be considered free parameters, and will be set
 * by the function.  Values of +/-infinity are not allowed.
 * \param accelerations An optional vector of acceleration constraints at the
 * corresponding waypoints; should either be NULL or num_waypoints in length.
 * Any elements that are NAN will be considered free parameters, and will be set
 * by the function.  Values of +/-infinity are not allowed.
 * \param time_vector A vector of times to reach each waypoint; this must
 * be defined (not NULL, and not NAN for any element).  The first element must
 * be zero.
 *
 * \returns A HebiTrajectory object if there were no errors, and the trajectory
 * has been created. A NULL value indicates that there was an error, but does
